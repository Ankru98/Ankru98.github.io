                                        <h3>Online study at BIT in Beijing from South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore & Malaysia.</h3>
                                        <h4>Part I: Korea</h4>
                                            <p>During my time abroad, I maintained a private blog to regularly update my friends and family. 
                                                Due to my usual laziness, I am not going to rewrite all my entries. Therefore, I just basically share some entries
                                                and picture from that blog.
                                            <h6>Seoul Part I</h6>
                                            <p>After now almost 9 days in Seoul (meaning: Capital) I thought an update seems reasonable &#128513; <br>
                                                The arriving has been easier than expected: while I needed to fill out five sheets concerning 
                                                several declarations in the airplane, they don’t needed them at the airport since I organized a 
                                                certain QR code beforehand.<br>
                                                Yet, I discovered most of the public or touristic places (I heard of). On my first day I went 
                                                more or less randomly to the famous Namsan Park/Seoul Tower showing how huge this city is. 
                                                In the evening I met a friend of mine for dinner and I accidentally bought THE alcohol drink in 
                                                South Korea - Soju (13%, traditionally made from the grain of rice, wheat, or barley). 
                                                There are several old districts of palaces from former kings of Korea distributed throughout 
                                                the city such as Changdeokgung Palace or Gyeongbokgung Palace. Also I discovered trendy 
                                                districts such as Bukcheon, Insa-Dong, Gangnam or Hongdae which have been very exciting. 
                                                There are so many people and the quantity and variety of possibilities to eat is insane. 
                                                Randomly we saw a ceremony of Buddhists. Also, I went on a hike in the Bukhansan National Park 
                                                (those who have me on Snapchat know how it went &#128517;)… <br>
                                                The past days have been very intensive. For my second part the focus lies now in trying even 
                                                more Korean food specialities and studying. For 2 modules we need to provide presentations.</p>

                                                <h6>Seoul Part II</h6>
                                                <p>Tomorrow I’ll be traveling to Busan, the second biggest city in the south of Korea. 
                                                    For that, I decided to use the KTX - a train with pace up to 350 km/h. <br>
                                                    Even though I thought that I’ve already seen so many things here, this second part surprised 
                                                    me with a lot of new impressions. <br> 
                                                    After the first part I have resolved to try even more Korean food, especially those who 
                                                    are famous in Seoul. So, I started with a Tosokchon Ginseng Chicken Soup - chicken filled 
                                                    with rice and other stuff. Usually, I enjoy to sleep as long as possible but for one day I 
                                                    got up at 4.30 to visit the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market to see auctions. 
                                                    Sadly, it seemed like they had already done most of the business. Due to the price and some 
                                                    moral issues I also declined the idea of trying some king crabs (they are so huge!). 
                                                    A quick research on YouTube recommended a restaurant which produces their own tofu in front 
                                                    of it. It seemed like my research was very bad, since this was not the only place that has 
                                                    been shut down before my visit… Beyond that, I ate at several bakery’s (no sourdough here 
                                                    which I actually really miss), tried shaved ice cream with red beans & finally I went to my 
                                                    first Korean BBQ with a fellow student, who was supposed to study with me im Beijing. 
                                                    His parents are currently living in Seoul.. (what a coincidence!). The last highlight of my 
                                                    time in Seoul definitely has been the visit of the famous Gwangjang Market. There has been 
                                                    a Netflix documentation (Street Food Asia S1 E6) about this place and I must have tried 
                                                    that dish - hand knived noodle soup and kimchi/meat dumplings! <br>
                                                    Furthermore, I went to the financial area (of course), the city center around the city hall 
                                                    again,  the Gyeongbokgung Palace & walked near the cheong-gyecheon stream. One of the 
                                                    highlights so far has been my tour to the DMZ splitting South and North Korea. The area is 
                                                    completely restricted by the army so there was no other option than to book a guided tour. 
                                                    We have seen the bridge of freedom, the third tunnel and the Dora observatory while getting 
                                                    a lot of information about the history of that countries (the tour guide always called the 
                                                    leader of North Korea “crazy fat boy”). To my surprise I’ve never felt uncomfortable or 
                                                    scared. Even though my previous experience in the Bukhansan Nationalpark was rather whack 
                                                    (my own fault) I went there once more and didn’t regret it. <br>
                                                    Korean people are in love with baseball (in the metro everyone regardless the age is 
                                                    constantly on their phone and they are watching baseball very often). So, I went to see 
                                                    the Gocheok Sky Dome and there actually played Kiwoom and I spontaneously bought a ticket. 
                                                    Nevertheless, the Doosan Bears seem to be one of the most famous team in South Korea, 
                                                    that’s why I also went to one of their home games at Jamsil Stadium & bought their jersey 
                                                    to hold on to the memories!</p>

                                                <h6>Busan Part I</h6>
                                                <p>Second Stop: Busan! <br>
                                                    I must admit that I really love Busan. Compared to Seoul it’s friendly, relaxing and not 
                                                    that busy. The food is still amazing tho, as you can see &#128513; <br>                                                     
                                                    The first two days were not really spectacular, because I had to attend lectures in Beijing 
                                                    & present my first group work. Compared to my experiences in Germany the classes are not 
                                                    challenging at all. <br>                                                    
                                                    Then, I started to discover the city on my own & went to different places such as: a 
                                                    rooftop park at the Lotte Department Store Gwangbok Branch, the Busan Tower, the 
                                                    Gwangbok-dong cultural & fashion street, Gukje market, Gamcheon Culture Village and the 
                                                    Songdo Beach. From there on I took the cable car to the Songdo Sky Park - the view was 
                                                    extraordinary! On the other day I wanted to hike to the Geumjeongsan peak. Just after my 
                                                    start I decided to cancel my plans (there were no signs and tracks) and get myself a iced 
                                                    latte with a view instead. After to beach days at Gwangalli Beach and Haeundae Beach, where 
                                                    I also visited Dongbeak Island, I went out for my second Korean BBQ. My company has been 
                                                    two really nice Canadians from my hostel, who are traveling through Southeast Asia and 
                                                    Australia in the next year 🤘🏽 After a more than sufficient (and efficient) meal we 
                                                    discovered the night life in Seomyeon. The next day we wanted to see a drone show while 
                                                    eating some fried chicken at the beach - just vibing with the street artists. And finally, 
                                                    we went to Spa Land today! 13 Sauna’s, bath tubes and food places maintain to relax everyone. <br> 
                                                    Let’s talk about the food. So, I tried once more some fried chicken with a German guy I met at 
                                                    another hostel. Next to my hostel are two really tasty places:  Choryang Milmyeon (cold noodles 
                                                    and dumplings) and a traditional Chinese dumplings place (shrimp & spicy fried 🤤). And I ate Udon 
                                                    noodles and Tteokbokki (spicy fried rice cake) at a street food market. <br>
                                                    The plans for my second part in Busan make me feel even more exited!</p>

                                                <p>After a really tough night I just arrived on Jeju Island (you can see how it went on the 
                                                    last pictures/videos). Once more it has been shown that “the sea” is not my preferred 
                                                    element. At least I didn’t throw up. Anyway, I’ll keep this post rather short &#128517; <br>
                                                    Some touristic attractions I visited: Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, Cheongsapo Daritdol Skywalk, 
                                                    Jalgachi Market, Bujeoninsam Market & Taejongdae Resort Park. <br>                                                    
                                                    Short recap what happened recently:
                                                    I went to all you can eat two more times (it’s simply affordable & really tasty) with my 
                                                    Canadian friends Jacob & Margaux. The last time we celebrated their Thanksgiving together 
                                                    with some other people living in the hostel. <br>                                                    
                                                    For my trip, I really wanted to use the offer of a temple stay. Since I didn’t went to the 
                                                    eastern part of Korea (where I originally intended to do it), I explored the Beomeosa temple 
                                                    for 2 days. Summarizing it has been an interesting experience, but in total it was not worth 
                                                    it. While booking this, I thought we would “do something” in the relaxing time. Instead, they 
                                                    offered nothing and we just stayed in our room. <br>                                                    
                                                    Special mention: Yannis & Justin really send me a package lol. Besides things I really 
                                                    craved such as German bread, gummy bears & cookies, it also includes some useless things to 
                                                    me as I know it from former packages &#128514; <br>                                                    
                                                    Surprisingly, I found out that you can actually surf in Korea. So did I for some hours & 
                                                    headed back to Haeundae Beach by a sky capsule, where I have seen a wonderful sunset. My 
                                                    highlight of the pst days has been my first paraglide ride for sure! Therefore I went to 
                                                    Singyeongju where 3 very friendly Korean men picked me up, drove me up  the mountain and 
                                                    shared this whole experience with me! <br>
                                                    In the last two days I searched in several markets for some accessoires for my own kitchen.</p>

                                                <p>Today I’ll take the ferry back to Busan to move on to my second country on this trip. <br>
                                                    I spend the first days in Jeju-Si to prepare a job interview, which went quite well. Now I 
                                                    need to submit a coding assignment in the end of this week. The things I intended to do 
                                                    after my preparation has been complete fails. First I went to the wrong stadium to see a 
                                                    football match & then I drove to the Hallasan mountain just to find out, that you need to 
                                                    have a reservation.. At least I could try the famous black pork bbq. To be honest, it wasn’t 
                                                    worth the money. But at least I tried abalones there for the first time. <br>                                                    
                                                    But, the second part changed my Jeju experience completely. I spend some days in Seogwipo. 
                                                    The island is famous for it’s Hallabong, which is a fruit similar to oranges and tangerines 
                                                    but has a „more typical flavor“. The juice is amazing, I also tried cafe latte combined 
                                                    with the juice (can’t recommend that) & Radler with hallabong instead of lemonade, which 
                                                    tastes amazing! My favorite part certainly has been Olle Market. I had bread filled with 
                                                    red lobster every day, got some friends there so they gifted me sometimes with free food &#128563; 
                                                    beyond that, I found a Korean brewery and tasted unique beer combinations (Chocolate Porter, Hazy 
                                                    IPA, Lemon Basil, Apple Cider /w Korean Berry, …). I’ve seen so many pretty sunset’s. But there is 
                                                    one famous spot to witness the most beautiful sunrise. So, I drove to Seongsan Ilchulbong (Sunrise 
                                                    Peak) in the early morning. Due to the bus schedule I arrived a bit to late.. nonetheless, I met 
                                                    Monica & Andrew, a Korean couple from northern Seoul, and talked to them about a hour. Afterward 
                                                    I visited the Manjang Cave. Hallasan is actually an active vulcono (which has not erupted in 5000 
                                                    years), so you can see the tubes from that time. One highlight definitely has been my first time 
                                                    in a submarine to explore the world underwater. <br>
                                                    They even sell Makgeolli with Hallabong taste here. The best I’ve had so far! I had one more bbq, 
                                                    tried peanut dumplings & had some sashimi. And finally, on my last day on Jeju I could hike to the 
                                                    hallasan peak. 1900 m height in 3:40h. Above the clouds it has been freezing and the wind was not 
                                                    that easy to handle with 😂 even tho I’m totally exhausted now, it has been a great experience! 
                                                    At my last evening I tried lobster with cheese and drunk one more beer at my favorite place. I kind 
                                                    of made friends with their coworker, so they surprised me with a bottle of their special 
                                                    combination as a gift. <br>
                                                    Right now I’m sitting in the lobby, waiting to take the bus to the ferry terminal. 
                                                    Unfortunately, I need to do some uni stuff until then...</p>
